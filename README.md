# Mobile_AR

Simple augmented reality application, that hosts an HTML based server on a web browser. This application scans a marker of our choosing then displays a 3D model on top of it. We are still currently working on physical interaction with the 3D model. 

The finalized product will be able to do the following along with everything else that has been implemented already:
* Send out push notifications to alert users about new or related 3D models
* Functional Website to showcase different models
* Display a log of scanned QR codes and their related models
* Set up a local host server
